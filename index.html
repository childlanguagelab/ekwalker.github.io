        When families do not participate in a session, it is the early intervention provider's responsibility to find a way to engage the parent.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Families who do not do follow-up activities are less invested in their children.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        The role of early intervention providers should be to train, teach, or coach the parents- not to work directly with the child.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        The parent's role should be to act as their child's parent, not as their teacher.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        When early intervention providers teach parents skills to use with their children, parents feel they are not being viewed as capable of meeting their child's needs.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        The child's participation in family activities/routines is more important than learning developmental skills.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        It is acceptable for providers to do hands-on intervention when families want the provider to work directly with the child.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        All families have the knowledge to select strategies to help their children learn.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Early intervention services should be targeted to the developmental concerns which the family, not the provider, feels are most important.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Early intervention services should always be provided in the home.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        There are no circumstances where it is acceptable for early intervention providers to bring in their own materials.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Early intervention providers should include other children who are present during a session.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Service coordinators should be the team members who collect all the information about the family's activities/routines.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        In order for families to successfully access resources, service coordinators need to provide more assistance than written information or contact names.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        The child's engagement (e.g. interest/happiness) should be of primary importance in a session.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Sessions should be oriented to what the child needs to learn how to do.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        Keeping records of their work with children helps providers make informed decisions about what they are teaching families to do.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        There are no opportunities for teamwork or collaboration among providers when early intervention services are provided by independent providers.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        All early intervention providers, regardless of their discipline, have the skills and abilities to work effectively with all infants and toddlers.
      </div>
      <div class="question bucket-0" draggable="true">
        An early intervention provider's competence is related more to their formal training (e.g. graduate) than to their on-the-job experiences
